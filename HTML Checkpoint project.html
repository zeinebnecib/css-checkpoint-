The Covid-19 has not stopped shaking the whole world for 2 months, impacting the economic, health and social situation. In Tunisia, the pandemic is evolving every day and the toll is getting worse and worse. We offer our deep condolences to the relatives of the victims and we greatly support them in this difficult situation.</p>

8 years of commitment and action
Happiness is shared!
The Children's Support Association was created on November 5, 2010 by young Tunisian students in Paris.
            
            These young students wanted to help Tunisian children, in particular for orphan children at the SOS Mahres center.
           
            This momentum of solidarity was accentuated by the Tunisian revolution which made it possible to discover the misery of the regions and to be able to launch development projects there in terms of education, social, local economy and health. . We work in the field all over Tunisia and operate mainly in interior regions.
